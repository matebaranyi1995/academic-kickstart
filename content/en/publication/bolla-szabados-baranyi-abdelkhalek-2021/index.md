abstract: Studying the eﬀectiveness of remedial courses in higher education has attracted
  a lot of interest from educational researchers and practitioners. Remediation is
  associated with signiﬁcant economic and social costs while the results are usually
  dubious. In this paper, we apply a widely used method called Regression Discontinuity
  Design (RDD) to measure the eﬀectiveness of two diﬀerently designed remedial mathematics
  courses at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Our large-scale
  study is based on data of almost 20,000 undergraduate students enrolled between
  2010 and 2018. Using modern RDD tools in various settings, we study both the direct
  and longer-term eﬀects of remediation; and ﬁnd that the design of the remedial course
  matters a lot. We measured a statistically signiﬁcant positive eﬀect on subsequent
  academic achievement for both course designs; however, the magnitude of the eﬀect
  diﬀers substantially. We measured a higher eﬀect for the remedial course that serves
  as an extra practice class for the university level calculus course than for traditional
  remediation. As a methodological novelty, we propose a novel alternative method
  to handle discrete running variable in the RDD setting. We also provide some suggestions
  on how to improve mathematical remediation using personalized e-learning systems.
