abstract: Constructions for regression graphs and verification of the statistical
  model via linear, linearized, and logistic regressions along them have recently
  been intensively studied. Given the graph, an iterative regression method, using
  local averaging estimators, is introduced for prediction, based on a complete training
  sample. The method makes it possible to perform nonparametric regressions recursively,
  irrespective of the type of the context and response variables. As a consequence,
  predictions for the multiple response variables of a test sample are performed in
  the possession of their context variables only. Consistency is proved if the joint
  distribution is Markov compatible with a DAG or with a regression graph. In the
  latter case, the prediction goes on from chain component to chain component, with
  vector valued smoothers, mainly of product kernel types in the implementation. Practical
  considerations and application to randomly generated and real-world data are also
  presented.
