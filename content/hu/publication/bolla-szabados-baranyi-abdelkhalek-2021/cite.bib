 abstract = {Studying the eﬀectiveness of remedial courses in higher education has attracted a lot of interest from educational researchers and practitioners. Remediation is associated with signiﬁcant economic and social costs while the results are usually dubious. In this paper, we apply a widely used method called Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to measure the eﬀectiveness of two diﬀerently designed remedial mathematics courses at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Our large-scale study is based on data of almost 20,000 undergraduate students enrolled between 2010 and 2018. Using modern RDD tools in various settings, we study both the direct and longer-term eﬀects of remediation; and ﬁnd that the design of the remedial course matters a lot. We measured a statistically signiﬁcant positive eﬀect on subsequent academic achievement for both course designs; however, the magnitude of the eﬀect diﬀers substantially. We measured a higher eﬀect for the remedial course that serves as an extra practice class for the university level calculus course than for traditional remediation. As a methodological novelty, we propose a novel alternative method to handle discrete running variable in the RDD setting. We also provide some suggestions on how to improve mathematical remediation using personalized e-learning systems.},
