abstract: Studying the effectiveness of remediation courses in higher education has
  attracted a lot of interest from educational researchers and practitioners. Remediation
  is associated with significant economic and social costs while the results are usually
  dubious. In this paper, we applied a widely used method called Regression Discontinuity
  Design to measure the effectiveness of mathematical remediation courses of the Budapest
  University of Technology and Economics. Our large-scale study is based on data of
  20,000 undergraduate students enrolled between 2010 and 2018 spanning 16 semesters.
  We study both the direct and longer term effect of remediation and find that it
  has small but statistically significant positive effect on further academic achievement.
