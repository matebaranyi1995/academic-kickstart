  abstract = {Studying the effectiveness of remediation courses in higher education has attracted a lot of interest from educational researchers and practitioners. Remediation is associated with significant economic and social costs while the results are usually dubious. In this paper, we applied a widely used method called Regression Discontinuity Design to measure the effectiveness of mathematical remediation courses of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Our large-scale study is based on data of 20,000 undergraduate students enrolled between 2010 and 2018 spanning 16 semesters. We study both the direct and longer term effect of remediation and find that it has small but statistically significant positive effect on further academic achievement.},

  abstract = {Dropping out from STEM higher education is a severe global issue that needs action and solution, in Hungary the dropout rate is particularly high. Exploring the causes of early school leaving is a well-studied research topic of great interest. In this paper, we study the relationship between pre-enrollment achievement measures and indicators of first-year university performance, using Bayesian networks, based on the academic data of students of the mechanical engineering bachelors program at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Bayesian networks are having their renaissance, thanks to the high number of openly available software tools. We demonstrate the applicability of Bayesian networks in the educational domain, moreover, we also include a high-level but detailed description of the algorithms, which other similar papers usually lack. Although the models perform generally quite well, we also point out inconsistencies in the results and some limitations of the models.},

  abstract = {This versatile topic goes back to the inventions of Gauss, Markov, and Gibbs, whose ideas are incorporated in graphical models and regression graphs. Later, the geneticist S. Wright (1923\textendash 1934) and the philosopher and computer scientist J. Pearl (1986\textendash 1987) developed the tools, but their notation is too complicated to formulate the mathematical background. Here we mainly follow the up-to-date discussion of statisticians S. Lauritzen and N. Wermuth, and try to juxtapose the directed\textendash undirected and discrete\textendash continuous cases.},
