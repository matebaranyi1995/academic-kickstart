  abstract = {Studying the effectiveness of remediation courses in higher education has attracted a lot of interest from educational researchers and practitioners. Remediation is associated with significant economic and social costs while the results are usually dubious. In this paper, we applied a widely used method called Regression Discontinuity Design to measure the effectiveness of mathematical remediation courses of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Our large-scale study is based on data of 20,000 undergraduate students enrolled between 2010 and 2018 spanning 16 semesters. We study both the direct and longer term effect of remediation and find that it has small but statistically significant positive effect on further academic achievement.},

  abstract = {Constructions for regression graphs and verification of the statistical model via linear, linearized, and logistic regressions along them have recently been intensively studied. Given the graph, an iterative regression method, using local averaging estimators, is introduced for prediction, based on a complete training sample. The method makes it possible to perform nonparametric regressions recursively, irrespective of the type of the context and response variables. As a consequence, predictions for the multiple response variables of a test sample are performed in the possession of their context variables only. Consistency is proved if the joint distribution is Markov compatible with a DAG or with a regression graph. In the latter case, the prediction goes on from chain component to chain component, with vector valued smoothers, mainly of product kernel types in the implementation. Practical considerations and application to randomly generated and real-world data are also presented.},

  abstract = {Dropping out from STEM higher education is a severe global issue that needs action and solution, in Hungary the dropout rate is particularly high. Exploring the causes of early school leaving is a well-studied research topic of great interest. In this paper, we study the relationship between pre-enrollment achievement measures and indicators of first-year university performance, using Bayesian networks, based on the academic data of students of the mechanical engineering bachelors program at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Bayesian networks are having their renaissance, thanks to the high number of openly available software tools. We demonstrate the applicability of Bayesian networks in the educational domain, moreover, we also include a high-level but detailed description of the algorithms, which other similar papers usually lack. Although the models perform generally quite well, we also point out inconsistencies in the results and some limitations of the models.},

Wright (1923\textendash 1934) and the philosopher and computer scientist J. Pearl (1986\textendash 1987) developed the tools, but their notation is too complicated to formulate the mathematical background. Here we mainly follow the up-to-date discussion of statisticians S.
